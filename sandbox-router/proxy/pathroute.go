// ParsePathRoute extracts routing information from a request path shaped as
// <prefix>/<namespace>/<id>/<port>/<rest...>, where prefix is the operator's
// configured --path-routing-prefix and escapedPath is the request path
// exactly as it arrived on the wire (r.URL.EscapedPath(), NOT r.URL.Path —
// the latter is already percent-decoded, which would silently collapse an
// encoded separator like "%2F" inside the upstream remainder into a literal
// "/", changing which path segment a browser resource request actually
// names).
//
// matched reports whether escapedPath even starts with prefix — the caller
// is expected to fall through to header-based ParseSandboxHeaders when it
// is false, which is not an error, just "this is not a path-routed
// request". A perr is only ever returned alongside matched=true: the path
// opted in to this routing mode but is otherwise malformed (missing
// segments, bad namespace/id/port).
//
// The same validation as ParseSandboxHeaders applies to namespace and id
// (validDNSLabel) and to port ([1, 65535]) — one shape for a Target
// regardless of which input carried it. Those three segments are decoded
// before validation: a client is free to percent-encode a character that
// didn't strictly need it, and decoding first is the conventional way a
// server honors that — a DNS label or a decimal port never legitimately
// contains an encoded "/" in the first place, so this can't reintroduce
// the ambiguity splitting on the still-escaped string was written to
// avoid. Port has no default here (unlike the header form's
// DefaultSandboxPort): a browser-facing path with no port is an authoring
// mistake worth surfacing immediately, not silently guessing.
//
// X-Sandbox-Pod-IP and X-Sandbox-UID have no path equivalent, by design:
// see the PathRoutingPrefix doc comment in package config for why.
