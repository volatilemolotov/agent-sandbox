| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` _string_ | name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although<br />some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name<br />automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration<br />definition.<br />Cannot be updated.<br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#names |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `labels` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | labels defines the map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize<br />(scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers<br />and services.<br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `annotations` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be<br />set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.

SandboxConditionReady and SandboxConditionSuspended).

_Validation:_
- Enum: [Running Suspended]

_Appears in:_
- [SandboxSpec](#sandboxspec)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Running` | SandboxOperatingModeRunning indicates the Sandbox should be actively running:<br />the controller ensures a backing Pod (and Service, if requested) is created and<br />kept running. This is a desired-state declaration only; observed readiness is<br />reported separately by the Ready condition (see SandboxConditionReady), which<br />stays False until the Pod is actually Running and Ready.<br /> |
| `Suspended` | SandboxOperatingModeSuspended indicates the Sandbox should be suspended: the<br />controller terminates the backing Pod while retaining the Sandbox object and its<br />volumes. Progress of the suspension is reported by the Suspended condition (see<br />SandboxConditionSuspended).<br /> |


#### SandboxSpec



SandboxSpec defines the desired state of Sandbox.
volumeClaimTemplates is immutable after creation.

SandboxTemplateSpec defines the desired state of Sandbox.



_Appears in:_
- [SandboxTemplate](#sandboxtemplate)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `podTemplate` _[PodTemplate](#podtemplate)_ | podTemplate describes the pod that will be created in the sandbox.<br />Note: When provisioned via a SandboxTemplate (such as by a SandboxClaim or SandboxWarmPool),<br />if AutomountServiceAccountToken is not specified in the PodSpec, the controller defaults it<br />to false to ensure a secure-by-default environment. |  | Required: \{\} <br /> |
| `volumeClaimTemplates` _[PersistentVolumeClaimTemplate](#persistentvolumeclaimtemplate) array_ | volumeClaimTemplates is a list of claims that the sandbox pod is allowed to reference.<br />When creating a sandbox, PVCs will be created from these templates.<br />Every claim in this list must have at least one matching access mode with a provisioner volume.<br />NOTE: This list is atomic. Updates to this field will replace the entire list rather than merging with existing entries. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `service` _boolean_ | service controls whether the controller should automatically create a<br />headless Service for the Sandbox workload.<br />When unset, the controller preserves existing Services for backward<br />compatibility but does not create new ones. Set to true to enable or false<br />to explicitly disable and remove the Service. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `networkPolicy` _[NetworkPolicySpec](#networkpolicyspec)_ | networkPolicy defines the network policy to be applied to the sandboxes<br />created from this template. A single shared NetworkPolicy is created per Template.<br />Behavior is dictated by the NetworkPolicyManagement field:<br />- If Management is "Unmanaged": This field is completely ignored.<br />- If Management is "Managed" (default) and this field is omitted (nil): The controller<br />  automatically applies a strict Secure Default policy:<br />    * Ingress: Allow traffic only from the Sandbox Router.<br />    * Egress: Allow Public Internet only. Blocks internal IPs (RFC1918), Metadata Server, etc.<br />- If Management is "Managed" and this field is provided: The controller applies your custom rules.<br />Update Behavior:<br />Because the NetworkPolicy is shared at the template level, any updates to these rules<br />will be applied to the single shared policy object. The underlying Kubernetes CNI will then<br />dynamically enforce the updated rules across all existing and future sandboxes<br />referencing this template.<br />NOTE: This is a restricted subset of the standard Kubernetes NetworkPolicySpec.<br />Fields like 'PodSelector' and 'PolicyTypes' are intentionally excluded because<br />they are managed by the controller to ensure strict isolation and default-deny posture.<br />WARNING: This policy enforces a strict "Default Deny" ingress posture.<br />If your Pod uses sidecars (e.g., Istio proxy, monitoring agents) that listen<br />on their own ports, the NetworkPolicy will BLOCK traffic to them by default.<br />You MUST explicitly allow traffic to these sidecar ports using 'Ingress',<br />otherwise the sidecars may fail health checks. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `networkPolicyManagement` _[NetworkPolicyManagement](#networkpolicymanagement)_ | networkPolicyManagement defines whether the controller manages the NetworkPolicy.<br />Valid values are "Managed" (default) or "Unmanaged". | Managed | Enum: [Managed Unmanaged] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `envVarsInjectionPolicy` _[EnvVarsInjectionPolicy](#envvarsinjectionpolicy)_ | envVarsInjectionPolicy controls whether a SandboxClaim may set environment variables<br />(spec.env) on sandboxes created from this template:<br />  - Disallowed (default): claims may not set any environment variables; a claim that<br />    specifies spec.env is rejected.<br />  - Allowed: claims may add environment variables whose names are not already defined<br />    in the template, but may not change the value of a name the template already defines.<br />  - Overrides: claims may add new environment variables and override the values of names<br />    the template already defines.<br />Note: environment variables are baked into the Pod before it is created; they cannot be<br />injected into an already-running warm pool Pod. Consequently, allowing injection here<br />(Allowed or Overrides) only takes effect on a per-claim basis: any claim that actually<br />sets spec.env is forced to cold-start a fresh Sandbox and cannot adopt a warm pool<br />Sandbox. Claims that set no environment variables still use the warm pool normally. | Disallowed | Enum: [Allowed Overrides Disallowed] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `volumeClaimTemplatesPolicy` _[VolumeClaimTemplatesPolicy](#volumeclaimtemplatespolicy)_ | volumeClaimTemplatesPolicy allows a SandboxClaim to inject or override volume claim templates defined in the template.<br />If set to Disallowed, the SandboxClaim will be rejected if it specifies any volume claim templates. | Disallowed | Enum: [Disallowed Allowed Overrides] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |

| `spec` _[SandboxWarmPoolSpec](#sandboxwarmpoolspec)_ | spec defines the desired state of SandboxWarmPool |  | Required: \{\} <br /> |
| `status` _[SandboxWarmPoolStatus](#sandboxwarmpoolstatus)_ | status defines the observed state of SandboxWarmPool |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### SandboxWarmPoolRef



SandboxWarmPoolRef references a SandboxWarmPool.



_Appears in:_
- [SandboxClaimSpec](#sandboxclaimspec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` _string_ | name of the SandboxWarmPool |  | Required: \{\} <br /> |


#### SandboxWarmPoolSpec



SandboxWarmPoolSpec defines the desired state of SandboxWarmPool.



_Appears in:_
- [SandboxWarmPool](#sandboxwarmpool)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `replicas` _integer_ | replicas is the desired number of sandboxes in the pool.<br />This field is controlled by an HPA if specified. | 1 | Minimum: 0 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `sandboxTemplateRef` _[SandboxTemplateRef](#sandboxtemplateref)_ | sandboxTemplateRef - name of the SandboxTemplate to be used for creating a Sandbox<br />Warning: Any change to the json tag "sandboxTemplateRef" must be synchronized with the TemplateRefField constant. |  | Required: \{\} <br /> |
| `updateStrategy` _[SandboxWarmPoolUpdateStrategy](#sandboxwarmpoolupdatestrategy)_ | updateStrategy controls how the pool replaces its stale sandboxes. A sandbox is<br />considered stale when the effective SandboxBlueprint derived from the referenced<br />SandboxTemplate (or the sandboxTemplateRef name) changes; metadata-only edits<br />(annotations or labels) do not make a sandbox stale and never trigger replacement.<br />It applies only to sandboxes still owned by the pool (i.e. unclaimed). Once a sandbox<br />is claimed by a SandboxClaim, ownership transfers to the claim and the pool no longer<br />manages or replaces it.<br />Defaults to OnReplenish. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### SandboxWarmPoolStatus



SandboxWarmPoolStatus defines the observed state of SandboxWarmPool.



_Appears in:_
- [SandboxWarmPool](#sandboxwarmpool)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `replicas` _integer_ | replicas is the total number of sandboxes in the pool. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `readyReplicas` _integer_ | readyReplicas is the total number of sandboxes in the pool that are in a ready state. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `selector` _string_ | selector is the label selector used to find the pods in the pool. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `observedGeneration` _integer_ | observedGeneration is the most recent generation observed by the controller.<br />It corresponds to the SandboxWarmPool's metadata.generation, which is bumped<br />on spec mutations such as replicas changes. Note that SandboxTemplate content<br />changes do not bump the pool's generation, so this does not track template<br />rollout progress. |  | Minimum: 0 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### SandboxWarmPoolUpdateStrategy



SandboxWarmPoolUpdateStrategy defines the update strategy for the SandboxWarmPool.



_Appears in:_
- [SandboxWarmPoolSpec](#sandboxwarmpoolspec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` _[SandboxWarmPoolUpdateStrategyType](#sandboxwarmpoolupdatestrategytype)_ | type indicates the type of the SandboxWarmPoolUpdateStrategy.<br />Default is OnReplenish. | OnReplenish | Enum: [Recreate OnReplenish] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### SandboxWarmPoolUpdateStrategyType

_Underlying type:_ _string_

SandboxWarmPoolUpdateStrategyType is a string enumeration type that enumerates
all possible update strategies for the SandboxWarmPool controller.

_Validation:_
- Enum: [Recreate OnReplenish]

_Appears in:_
- [SandboxWarmPoolUpdateStrategy](#sandboxwarmpoolupdatestrategy)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Recreate` | RecreateSandboxWarmPoolUpdateStrategyType deletes stale unclaimed sandboxes immediately<br />so the pool only holds fresh sandboxes matching the current template. Already-claimed<br />sandboxes are never touched.<br />Note: This applies to changes in the template's SandboxBlueprint only. Changes to annotations, labels, or template-level policies do not trigger recreate.<br /> |
| `OnReplenish` | OnReplenishSandboxWarmPoolUpdateStrategyType leaves stale unclaimed sandboxes in place.<br />A stale sandbox is only replaced with a fresh one when it is manually deleted, or when it<br />is claimed by a SandboxClaim (which removes it from the pool and triggers replenishment).<br />Already-claimed sandboxes are never touched.<br /> |


#### ShutdownPolicy

_Underlying type:_ _string_

ShutdownPolicy describes the policy for shutting down the underlying Sandbox when the SandboxClaim expires.

_Validation:_
- Enum: [Delete DeleteForeground Retain]

_Appears in:_
- [Lifecycle](#lifecycle)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Delete` | ShutdownPolicyDelete deletes the SandboxClaim (and cascadingly the Sandbox) when expired.<br /> |
| `DeleteForeground` | ShutdownPolicyDeleteForeground deletes the SandboxClaim when expired using foreground<br />cascade deletion. The claim remains in the API (with a deletionTimestamp) until its<br />underlying Sandbox and Pod are fully terminated. This allows external systems to observe<br />shutdown progress by checking whether the claim still exists.<br /> |
| `Retain` | ShutdownPolicyRetain keeps the SandboxClaim when expired (Status will show Expired).<br />The underlying SandboxClaim resources (Sandbox, Pod, Service) are deleted to save resources,<br />but the SandboxClaim object itself remains.<br /> |


#### VolumeClaimTemplatesPolicy

_Underlying type:_ _string_

VolumeClaimTemplatesPolicy defines whether a SandboxClaim is allowed to inject or override volume claim templates.

_Validation:_
- Enum: [Disallowed Allowed Overrides]

_Appears in:_
- [SandboxTemplateSpec](#sandboxtemplatespec)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Disallowed` | VolumeClaimTemplatesPolicyDisallowed prevents a SandboxClaim from specifying any volume claim templates.<br /> |
| `Allowed` | VolumeClaimTemplatesPolicyAllowed allows a SandboxClaim to inject new volume claim templates, but not override existing ones.<br /> |
| `Overrides` | VolumeClaimTemplatesPolicyOverrides allows a SandboxClaim to inject new and override existing volume claim templates.<br /> |
