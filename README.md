# Agent Sandbox

**agent-sandbox enables easy management of isolated, stateful, singleton workloads, ideal for use cases like AI agent runtimes.**

This project is developing a `Sandbox` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and controller for Kubernetes, under the umbrella of [SIG Apps](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps). The goal is to provide a declarative, standardized API for managing workloads that require the characteristics of a long-running, stateful, singleton container with a stable identity, much like a lightweight, single-container VM experience built on Kubernetes primitives.

## Overview

### Core: Sandbox

The `Sandbox` CRD is the core of agent-sandbox. It provides a declarative API for managing a single, stateful pod with a stable identity and persistent storage. This is useful for workloads that don't fit well into the stateless, replicated model of Deployments or the numbered, stable model of StatefulSets.

Key features of the `Sandbox` CRD include:

*   **Stable Identity:** Each Sandbox has a stable hostname and network identity.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Sandboxes can be configured with persistent storage that survives restarts.
*   **Lifecycle Management:** The Sandbox controller manages the lifecycle of the pod, including creation, scheduled deletion, pausing and resuming.

### Extensions

The `extensions` module provides additional CRDs and controllers that build on the core `Sandbox` API to provide more advanced features.

*   `SandboxTemplate`: Provides a way to define reusable templates for creating Sandboxes, making it easier to manage large numbers of similar Sandboxes.
*   `SandboxClaim`: Allows users to create Sandboxes from a template, abstracting away the details of the underlying Sandbox configuration.
*   `SandboxWarmPool`: Manages a pool of pre-warmed Sandbox Pods that can be quickly allocated to users, reducing the time it takes to get a new Sandbox up and running.

## Installation

You can install the agent-sandbox controller and its CRDs with the following command.

```sh
# Replace "vX.Y.Z" with a specific version tag (e.g., "v0.1.0") from
# https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/releases
export VERSION="vX.Y.Z"

# To install only the core components:
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/releases/download/${VERSION}/manifest.yaml

# To install the extensions components:
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/releases/download/${VERSION}/extensions.yaml
```

## Getting Started

Once you have installed the controller, you can create a simple Sandbox by applying the following YAML to your cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: agents.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Sandbox
metadata:
  name: my-sandbox
spec:
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: <IMAGE>
```

This will create a new Sandbox named `my-sandbox` running the image you specify. You can then access the Sandbox using its stable hostname, `my-sandbox`.

For a more programatic approach you can use the [SDK](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/blob/main/clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client/README.md) like the following:
```python
from agentic_sandbox import Sandbox

# The SDK abstracts all YAML into a simple context manager
try:
    with Sandbox(
        template_name="python-runtime-template",
        namespace="ai-agents"
    ) as sandbox:

        print("--- Sandbox is Ready! ---")

        # 1. Run a command inside the secure sandbox
        result = sandbox.run("echo 'Hello from inside the sandbox!'")
        print(f"Stdout: {result.stdout.strip()}")

        # 2. Write and read files
        sandbox.write("test.txt", "This is a test file.")
        content = sandbox.read("test.txt").decode('utf-8')
        print(f"Read content: {content}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# The 'with' block automatically handles cleanup
print("--- Sandbox Cleaned Up ---")
```

## Motivation

Kubernetes excels at managing stateless, replicated applications (Deployments) and stable, numbered sets of stateful pods (StatefulSets). However, there's a growing need for an abstraction to handle use cases such as:

*   **Development Environments:** Isolated, persistent, network-accessible cloud environments for developers.
*   **AI Agent Runtimes:** Isolated environments for executing untrusted, LLM-generated code.
*   **Notebooks and Research Tools:** Persistent, single-container sessions for tools like Jupyter Notebooks.
*   **Stateful Single-Pod Services:** Hosting single-instance applications (e.g., build agents, small databases) needing a stable identity without StatefulSet overhead.

While these can be approximated by combining StatefulSets (size 1), Services, and PersistentVolumeClaims, this approach is cumbersome and lacks specialized lifecycle management like hibernation.

## Desired Sandbox Characteristics

We aim for the Sandbox to be vendor-neutral, supporting various runtimes. Key characteristics include:

*   **Strong Isolation:** Supporting different runtimes like gVisor or Kata Containers to provide enhanced security and isolation between the sandbox and the host, including both kernel and network isolation. This is crucial for running untrusted code or multi-tenant scenarios.
*   **Deep hibernation:** Saving state to persistent storage and potentially archiving the Sandbox object.
*   **Automatic resume:** Resuming a sandbox on network connection.
*   **Efficient persistence:** Elastic and rapidly provisioned storage.
*   **Memory sharing across sandboxes:** Exploring possibilities to share memory across Sandboxes on the same host, even if they are primarily non-homogenous. This capability is a feature of the specific runtime, and users should select a runtime that aligns with their security and performance requirements.
*   **Rich identity & connectivity:** Exploring dual user/sandbox identities and efficient traffic routing without per-sandbox Services.
*   **Programmable:** Encouraging applications and agents to programmatically consume the Sandbox API.
