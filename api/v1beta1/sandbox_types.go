// ConditionType is a type of condition for a resource.
//
// Terminology: a Sandbox has two distinct notions that are easy to confuse.
//   - "running" is a desired state expressed by the user via spec.operatingMode
//     (see SandboxOperatingModeRunning). It says the controller should create and
//     keep a backing Pod. It does not, by itself, mean the Pod is up yet.
//   - "readiness" is an observed state reported by the Ready condition
//     (see SandboxConditionReady). It becomes True only once the backing Pod is
//     actually Running and Ready with an assigned IP (and its Service exists, if
//     requested). Note there is deliberately no separate "Running" status
//     condition: whether the Pod is running is subsumed by Ready (an unready Pod
//     that is still starting reports Ready=False with reason DependenciesNotReady).
//
// Condition names and semantics follow the Kubernetes/Gateway API conventions for
// status conditions (abnormal-true vs. normal-true polarity, stable reason strings,
// observedGeneration) so consumers can reason about them uniformly. See the Gateway
// API condition guidelines as a model:
// https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1364/
