## Troubleshooting Agent Sandboxes

In complex agentic workflows, execution failures can happen at multiple layers—from missing dependencies in your Python environment to network timeouts and cluster-level resource exhaustion. 

While standard errors are often surfaced directly in your script, the `k8s_agent_sandbox` SDK provides specialized tools and methodologies to inspect, trace, and debug your sandbox environments effectively.

### Built-in Log Tracing

When you need granular visibility into the API calls the SDK is making to the Sandbox Router, you can enable built-in log tracing. This is particularly useful when sandbox creation hangs or connection errors occur.

To use this feature, you must install the SDK with the `tracing` extra:

```bash
pip install "k8s-agent-sandbox[tracing]"
```

Example code:

```python
from k8s_agent_sandbox import SandboxClient

client = SandboxClient()
sandbox = client.create_sandbox("simple-sandbox-template")
payload = "echo 'Hello World!'"
response = sandbox.commands.run(payload)

print(response)
```

Example output:
```log
Creating SandboxClaim 'sandbox-claim-66ae1a5e' in namespace 'default' using template 'simple-sandbox-template'...
2026-04-15 16:52:11,634 - INFO - Resolving sandbox name from claim 'sandbox-claim-66ae1a5e'...

```

### Custom Sandbox Images and Output Inspection

Often, agent code fails because the environment lacks necessary system packages or dependencies. If your agent requires a specific setup, you should build a custom Docker image, push it to your registry, and reference it in your Kubernetes `SandboxTemplate`.

When executing commands inside this custom environment, the `response` object is your primary debugging tool. It strictly separates standard output, standard error, and the exit code.

#### Output Inspection Example

This example shows how to robustly check the execution results of a command, which is critical when validating custom Docker image behaviors.

```python
from k8s_agent_sandbox import SandboxClient

client = SandboxClient()

# 1. Create a sandbox using a template that references your custom Docker image
sandbox = client.create_sandbox("simple-sandbox-template")

# 2. Run a command that might fail (e.g., executing a script with missing dependencies)
response = sandbox.commands.run("python3 /app/agent_script.py")

# 3. Inspect the execution results
if response.exit_code != 0:
    print(f"Execution Failed with exit code: {response.exit_code}")
    print(f"Error Details (stderr): {response.stderr}")
else:
    print(f"Execution Succeeded!")
    print(f"Output (stdout): {response.stdout}")

sandbox.terminate()
```

The output:
```log
Execution Failed with exit code: 2
Error Details (stderr): python3: can't open file '/app/agent_script.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

### Infrastructure Diagnostics with kubectl

If the Python SDK is timing out before a sandbox is even returned, the issue is likely occurring at the cluster infrastructure layer. Because the SDK interacts with Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) under the hood, `kubectl` is the best way to verify cluster state.

You can run the following commands in your terminal to diagnose the Sandbox Controller and Router.

#### Essential Diagnostic Commands

Check the status of your sandbox templates to ensure your custom images are properly registered:
```bash
# Verify the template exists and is ready
kubectl get sandboxtemplates
```

When `create_sandbox()` hangs, it usually means the controller cannot fulfill the claim (e.g., due to insufficient node resources or an exhausted warm pool). Inspect the claims:
```bash
# List all claims and check if any are stuck in "Pending"
kubectl get sandboxclaims

# Describe a specific pending claim to see event logs and errors
kubectl describe sandboxclaim <claim-name>
```

Finally, the Sandbox Router is responsible for translating the SDK's REST calls into cluster actions. Viewing its logs will reveal deeper backend issues:
```bash
# Locate the sandbox-router pod
kubectl get pods -n default | grep sandbox-router

# Tail the logs for errors
kubectl logs <sandbox-router-pod-name> -f
```
