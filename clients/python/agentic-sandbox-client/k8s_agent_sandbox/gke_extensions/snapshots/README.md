# Agentic Sandbox Pod Snapshot Extension

This directory contains the Python client extension for interacting with the Agentic Sandbox to manage Pod Snapshots. This extension allows you to trigger snapshots of a running sandbox and restore a new sandbox from the recently created snapshot.

## Components

The snapshot functionality is driven by two main components:

### `PodSnapshotSandboxClient`
The main entry point for the snapshot extension. It inherits from the base `SandboxClient` but automatically validates that the required GKE Pod Snapshot CRDs are installed on the cluster upon initialization. It ensures that all sandboxes created via this client are instantiated as `SandboxWithSnapshotSupport`.

### `SandboxWithSnapshotSupport`
This class wraps the base `Sandbox` to seamlessly provide snapshot capabilities. It manages the sandbox lifecycle while granting access to the underlying snapshot operations via the `.snapshots` property.

### `SnapshotEngine`
The core engine responsible for interacting with the GKE Pod Snapshot Controller.
*   Creates `PodSnapshotManualTrigger` custom resources.
*   Watches for the snapshot controller to process the trigger and create a `PodSnapshot` resource.
*   Returns a structured `SnapshotResponse` containing the success status, error details, and `snapshot_uid`.
*   Ensures that manual trigger resources are cleanly deleted when the sandbox context exits.

## Usage Example

Here is an example demonstrating how to initialize the client and trigger a snapshot:

```python
from k8s_agent_sandbox.gke_extensions.snapshots import PodSnapshotSandboxClient

# Initialize the specialized snapshot client
client = PodSnapshotSandboxClient()

# Create a sandbox with snapshot capabilities enabled
sandbox = client.create_sandbox(
    template_name="python-counter-template", 
    namespace="default"
)

try:
    # Trigger a snapshot via the snapshots engine
    response = sandbox.snapshots.create("my-first-snapshot")

    if response.success:
        print(f"Snapshot created successfully! UID: {response.snapshot_uid}")
    else:
        print(f"Snapshot failed: {response.error_reason}")
finally:
    sandbox.terminate()
```

## `test_podsnapshot_extension.py`

This file, located in the parent directory (`clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client/`), contains an integration test script for the `PodSnapshotSandboxClient` extension. It verifies the snapshot and restore functionality.

### Test Phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Starting Counter Sandbox & Snapshotting**:
    *   Starts a sandbox with a counter application.
    *   Takes a snapshot (`test-snapshot-10`) after ~10 seconds.
    *   Takes a snapshot (`test-snapshot-20`) after ~20 seconds.
2.  **Phase 2: Restoring from Recent Snapshot**:
    *   Restores a sandbox from the second snapshot.
    *   Verifies that sandbox has been restored from the recent snapshot. 

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install kubernetes
    pip install -e clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client/
    ```

3.  **Pod Snapshot Controller**: The Pod Snapshot controller must be installed in a **GKE standard cluster** running with **gVisor**. 
   * For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [GKE Pod Snapshots public documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/pod-snapshots).
   * Ensure a GCS bucket is configured to store the pod snapshot states and that the necessary IAM permissions are applied.

4.  **CRDs**: `PodSnapshotStorageConfig`, `PodSnapshotPolicy` CRDs must be applied. `PodSnapshotPolicy` should specify the selector match labels.

5.  **Sandbox Template**: A `SandboxTemplate` (e.g., `python-counter-template`) with runtime gVisor, appropriate KSA and label that matches that selector label in `PodSnapshotPolicy` must be available in the cluster.

### Running Tests:

To run the integration test, execute the script with the appropriate arguments:

```bash
python3 clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client/test_podsnapshot_extension.py \
  --template-name python-counter-template \
  --namespace sandbox-test
```

Adjust the `--namespace`, `--template-name` as needed for your environment.
