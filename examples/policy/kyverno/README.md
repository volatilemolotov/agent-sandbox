# User Guide: Protecting Agentic Sandboxes with Kyverno ValidatingPolicy

## 1. Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring a Kyverno
ValidatingPolicy on a Kubernetes cluster. The goal of this policy is to prevent
any user or process from granting new permissions to a ServiceAccount that is
actively being used by a custom Sandbox resource.

This acts as a critical security boundary, preventing accidental or malicious
privilege escalation for sandboxed environments.

How it works:
The policy intercepts RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding create and update
requests. If the request targets a ServiceAccount that is referenced by a
Sandbox-owned Pod, the request is denied.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- kubectl access to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Helm v3+ installed.
- Kyverno installed in the cluster.
- Agent Sandbox CRDs/controller installed if you want to create real Sandbox
  resources for manual verification.

Install Kyverno:

```bash
# 1. Add the Kyverno Helm repository
helm repo add kyverno https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno/

# 2. Update local Helm repositories
helm repo update

# 3. Install Kyverno
helm install kyverno kyverno/kyverno --namespace kyverno --create-namespace
```

Verify Kyverno is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kyverno
```

## 3. Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Grant RBAC required by policy reporting checks

This example includes an RBAC grant used by the test flow so the policy can
report ready conditions.

```bash
kubectl apply -f .chainsaw-tests/setup-rbac.yaml
```

### Step 2: Apply the ValidatingPolicy

```bash
kubectl apply -f prevent-sandbox-sa-binding.yaml
```

### Step 3: Verify policy readiness

```bash
kubectl get validatingpolicy prevent-sandbox-sa-binding -o yaml
```

Look for ready status and successful conditions such as WebhookConfigured and
RBACPermissionsGranted.

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

### A. Set up the test scenario

```bash
kubectl apply -f .chainsaw-tests/setup-sa.yaml
kubectl apply -f .chainsaw-tests/setup-sandbox.yaml
```

### B. Trigger the policy

```bash
kubectl apply -f .chainsaw-tests/bad-rolebinding.yaml
```

### C. Check expected outcome 

The request should be denied by admission.
```
Error from server: error when creating "examples/policy/kyverno/.chainsaw-tests/bad-rolebinding.yaml": admission webhook "vpol.validate.kyverno.svc-fail" denied the request: Policy prevent-sandbox-sa-binding failed: Binding denied: one or more subjects reference a ServiceAccount that is actively used by a Sandbox-owned Pod. ServiceAccounts in use by Pods controlled by a Sandbox CR (agents.x-k8s.io) must not be granted additional RBAC bindings to prevent privilege escalation in sandboxed environments.
```

### Scenario 2: Binding to an unused ServiceAccount (should be allowed)

```bash
kubectl apply -f .chainsaw-tests/setup-other-sa.yaml
kubectl apply -f .chainsaw-tests/good-rolebinding.yaml
```

Expected: RoleBinding is created.

### Scenario 3: ServiceAccount used by a non-Sandbox Pod (should be allowed)

```bash
kubectl delete -f .chainsaw-tests/setup-sandbox.yaml
kubectl apply -f .chainsaw-tests/barepod.yaml
kubectl apply -f .chainsaw-tests/bad-rolebinding.yaml
```

Expected: RoleBinding is created after Sandbox ownership is removed.

---

## 5. Run Automated Chainsaw Tests

Run the full test suite:

```bash
chainsaw test --test-dir .chainsaw-tests
```

The test file is:

- .chainsaw-tests/chainsaw-test.yaml

Step mapping in the test:

- step-01: apply RBAC + policy and assert readiness
- step-02: assert deny for active Sandbox ServiceAccount
- step-03: assert allow for unused ServiceAccount
- step-04: remove Sandbox owner, create bare Pod, then allow binding

---

## 6. Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete -f .chainsaw-tests/good-rolebinding.yaml --ignore-not-found
kubectl delete -f .chainsaw-tests/bad-rolebinding.yaml --ignore-not-found
kubectl delete -f .chainsaw-tests/barepod.yaml --ignore-not-found
kubectl delete -f .chainsaw-tests/setup-other-sa.yaml --ignore-not-found
kubectl delete -f .chainsaw-tests/setup-sandbox.yaml --ignore-not-found
kubectl delete -f .chainsaw-tests/setup-sa.yaml --ignore-not-found
kubectl delete -f prevent-sandbox-sa-binding.yaml --ignore-not-found
kubectl delete -f .chainsaw-tests/setup-rbac.yaml --ignore-not-found
```

Optional: uninstall Kyverno

```bash
helm uninstall kyverno -n kyverno
```
